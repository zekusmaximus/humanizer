Tempus Dimittere

The rain, a threnos of telluric melancholy, liquesced the crepuscular air, a libation meet for the Götterdämmerung of Tempolith Septimus' arche. He, Tempolith Heptarch, scion of the Mantle of Temporal Cartography – a volumen inscribed with the stemma of kairos and aion, a chronotope woven from the very warp and woof of Ananke – stood upon the mola, the precipice of the Obsidian Clocktower, its gnomon, a skeletal index of Thanatos, casting a sepulchral umbra across Neo-Alexandria, a necropolis of anachronistic architectures – Gothic spires coalescing with chrome ziggurats, Art Deco façades marcescent beside bio-luminescent algal blooms – a visual discordia of temporal discordia, a memento mori etched in stone and steel, a vanitas vanitatum whispered on the wind, a danse macabre frozen in time. Below, the urbs, a petri dish of entropy and anomie, a microcosm of societal Weltschmerz, a theatrum mundi where players strutted and fretted their hour upon a stage of illusions, throbbed with a febrile anxiety, a collective angst, a morbus animi, echoing the existential dread of Sisyphus, forever rolling his boulder of meaninglessness up the mountain of time. Tempolith, however, felt only the gnawing acedia, the soul-weariness of Ecclesiastes, the taedium vitae of one who had gazed too long into the abyss and found it gazing back. His gaze, intransigent, was fixed upon the Temporum within the tower's vertex, a maelstrom of viridian and auriferous light, a chthonic vortex where the very warp and woof of temporality, the becoming of Heraclitus, writhed within its liminal confines, a nexus of all possibilities, a Maelstrom of potentiality.
He was glutted with the paradoxes, the causal anastrophes that constricted his sanity like the ouroboros, the serpent devouring its own tail, a symbol of the cyclical nature of time and its inherent contradictions, the antinomies of existence, the Gordian Knot of causality. The susurrus of the Echoes – eidola, phantasms of fractured timelines, discarded chronologies, apocryphal narratives of what might have been, whispers from the akashic records – pressed upon him, a cacophony of lost moments, a chorus of forgotten voices, a memento mori for every path not taken. They were not the whispers of wisdom, but the maddening cries of chronos imprisoned within the Lexicon, a Pandora's Box of temporal fragments, each vying for attention, each a shard of a broken whole. He felt himself a modern-day Atlas, not bearing the weight of the world, but the crushing burden of infinite possibilities, the topos of all potential pasts, presents, and futures, a chronos that stretched into infinity. The Lexicon, far from a key to understanding time, had become his prison, its pages bars of interwoven paradoxes, trapping him in an endless loop of regret and what-ifs. He was Prometheus chained to the rock of temporal knowledge, his liver perpetually pecked at by the carrion birds of consequence, the furies of causality.
Tonight, he would enact the Unraveling—a nefas ritual, a sacrilegium proscribed by the Nexarchs, a dance on the precipice of fate itself. He sought the punctum of divergence, the kairotic instant where his dromos had veered from ataraxia's path to this desolate abyss. He imagined himself a modern-day Faust, bargaining not with Mephistopheles, but with Time itself, seeking anamnesis—not just forgiveness for peccata, but the recovery of a lost, integrated self. He believed, with the desperate conviction of a Gnostic searching for hidden truths in a world of illusions, that within that infinitesimal instant lay the key to rewriting his praesens.
He reached for the clavis within his chronomancer's vestis—not simply a key of obsidian, but a talisman resonant with the echoes of forgotten selves. This was no mere unlocking of the Temporum's adytum, but a katabasis into the labyrinth of his own psyche, a descent into the underworld of memory where the Minotaur of regret awaited. The Aevometer, nestled within the folds of his robe, was not just a tool for navigating temporal currents, but a psychopomp guiding him through the treacherous landscape of his past, its needle a Sibyl's whisper revealing the tangled threads of causality. It was the instrumentum of his metanoia, a Palantír revealing not only the past, but the hidden pathways of his becoming.
The Temporum's viridian light engulfed him, transforming the city's temporal cacophony into a more intimate dissonance. The maelstrom of preserved moments that had haunted Neo-Alexandria's skies now became personal, immediate – each fragment a mirror reflecting his own fractured chronos. The vortex's embrace, a psychopomp of mnemosynic transmutation, dissolved the barriers between chronos and kairos, each recovered moment a pharmakon distilled through the alembic of Kronos' dream-time.
His childhood self-materialized not as mere anamnesis but as epiphanic reality, the topiary maze of the Nexarchs' gardens unfurling around him like Ouroboros' coils, a labyrinthine temenos where Tempolith and Aion danced their eternal pavane. Each hedge, sculpted with demiurgic precision into mathemata that mimicked the arboreal patterns of timeline divergence, whispered Pythagorean harmonies in the proto-glossolalia of creation. Here, in this locus amoenus, this Edenic sanctuary untouched by temporal entropy, young Septimus had first glimpsed the architectonic principles of time – not in dusty codices or hieratic lectures, but in the way autumn leaves traced logarithmic spirals, sempiternal shadows lengthening according to equations yet unborn from the matrix of possibility.
The memory-moment metamorphosed, reality inverting like Proteus' forms through a tesseract of consciousness, and he stood within the Grand Archive, that Alexandrian repository of temporal gnosis. The familiar redolence of aging papyri and ozone – the pneumatic tang of time itself – transported him to that kairotic day when Tempolith VI, his mystagogue, had first revealed the esoteric nature of their techne. "Time," the old man had intoned, his voice resonating with the gravitas of aeons, "is not Heraclitus' river but Poseidon's sea – and we are not its masters but its hierophantic cartographers." He had extended a hand, weathered as Sibylline leaves, offering the clavis to the forbidden adyta of the Archive. In that gesture lay both benediction and malediction, a pharmakon of gnosis that would simultaneously apotheose and annihilate.
The memory kaleidoscoped, timelines splintering like Narcissus' reflection in the pool of Mnemosyne. He witnessed himself accepting the key, but now – within the Temporum's apocalyptic embrace – he saw what he had missed before: the subtle tremulum in his mentor's hand, the shadow of Cassandra's curse in those ancient eyes. Tempolith VI had known, had always known, that this path led to catastrophe, a hubris as inevitable as Oedipus' fate. Yet he had offered the key anyway, fulfilling his role in the circular tragedy of their order, a hierophant leading his neophyte to necessary destruction. The betrayal was not in the act but in its inevitability, a predestined wound written into the very palimpsest of their relationship.
The scene deliquesced into a cascade of moments: his first successful temporal mapping, a cartographic epiphany worthy of Ptolemy, the discovery of the Echo phenomenon, synaesthetic whispers of the Lexicon calling to him through veils of probabilistic maya. But these memories now revealed their hidden valences, their deeper significances, each breakthrough a step not toward mastery but toward this moment of kenotic dissolution, this necessary apocalypsis of self. The Temporum was not merely showing him his past; it was revealing the intricate mandala of causation that had woven him into this present – each choice, each discovery, each moment of hybris or doubt as essential as the threads in Athena's tapestry.
Through it all pulsed that single, adamantine moment of divergence – not yet revealed but felt, like a discordant note in the Pythagorean harmony of memory. He reached for it instinctively, but the Temporum pulled him deeper, through strata of recollection and realization, each layer revealing new aspects of his own hamartia in what was to come. The truth of time was not in its measurement or manipulation, but in the way it bound all things together in an eternal chorea, a dance of cause and effect, choice, and consequence, eleutheria and ananke.
Through the kaleidoscope of memory, one moment began to crystallize with adamantine clarity, like a single Moira's thread gleaming among countless others. The Temporum's spiraling energies coalesced like Chaos resolving into Cosmos, the maelstrom of memory crystallizing into a single kairotic point, not a Promethean act of defiance but a quiet afternoon in the lower archives, a temenos where time's detritus accumulated like Lethe's silt.
The air had been thick with that peculiar stillness that preceded temporal storms, that liminal pause when reality held its breath like Tempolith before devouring his children. A young researcher – he could see her now with Mnemosyne's cruel clarity, her nomen reading "Cassandra Santos, Hierophant of Temporal Archaeology" – had been pursuing forbidden gnosis in the necropolis beneath Neo-Alexandria, where time-lost artifacts accumulated like sediment in Clio's depths.
Her notes lay scattered across the reading desk like Sibylline leaves: theoretical frameworks for recovering lost moments, for salvaging temporal fragments deemed too unstable for preservation, formulae that would make Pythagoras weep. Her calculations were elegant, ambitious, and utterly, catastrophically wrong – a hamartia buried in the temporal resistance equations, a single number that would cause the entire framework to collapse like Icarus from his heights. The protocols, handed down like Mosaic law from the first Chronarch, were clear: unauthorized research into temporal archaeology was anathema, the risks too great. He should have let Atropos' shears close, should have allowed the natural flow of time to eliminate this dangerous tangent from reality's palimpsest.
Instead, like Orpheus unable to resist one backward glance, he had taken her notes and made a single correction. One number changed, one line rewritten in his precise hand, a minimalist intervention that seemed as innocent as Pandora lifting the lid just a crack. He remembered thinking, with that peculiar hybris that preceded every tragic fall, how skillfully he had preserved the timeline while sparing a life. But now, within the Temporum's alethic embrace, he saw the truth: that single correction had been like Chaos' butterfly, its wings stirring temporal hurricanes too complex for even the Lexicon's omniscient pages to fully map.
Cassandra had lived, a modern Eurydice rescued not from Hades but from time's necessary pruning. She had continued her research, moving more cautiously but no less determined, like Prometheus understanding the cost of fire but unable to resist its allure. Others had followed in her wake, pushing against the boundaries of temporal orthodoxy until they began recovering artifacts that should have remained in Lethe's depths, restoring moments that Tempolith himself had tried to digest. The necropolis beneath Neo-Alexandria had stirred like Lazarus from his tomb, its depths releasing eidola of untold histories, fragments of discarded futures, until the very foundations of reality began to crack under the weight of too much preserved chronos.
The Temporum showed him all of it with Pythian clarity: the branching consequences, the cascading effects, the way his one act of misericordia had created hairline fractures in the temporal continuum that grew into chasms like Charybdis' maw. The Echoes that now haunted him were not just the whispers of what might have been – they were the accumulated weight of all that should not be, moments and memories that time itself had tried to edit away like a scribe expunging errors from sacred text. His intervention had preserved not just Cassandra's bios, but a whole tributary of time that nature had meant to prune, and now that preserved timeline was putting impossible strain on the entire temporal framework, like Atlas trying to bear double his burden.
He saw himself as he had been in that moment – younger, hubris radiating like Apollo's crown, certain of his right to choose which moments lived and which submitted to time's entropy. The irony of it struck him now: in trying to prevent one small tragedy, he had sown the seeds of Ragnarök. The Echoes that tormented him were not Erinyes of punishment but Cassandra's prophecy, the sound of time itself beginning to unravel under the weight of too many preserved possibilities.
The vision metamorphosed one final time, showing him Cassandra as she was now – a respected hierophant of temporal studies, her work having inspired a whole school of chrono-archaeological sophia. She had no idea that her entire existence, along with all the branches that had grown from it, was an amendment to time's original codex. No idea that her preserved life was part of what was now threatening to tear reality apart at its sutures, like Penelope's weaving coming undone at dusk. In saving her, he had not merely changed a single moment but had defied time's essential nature – its need to edit, to prune, to allow some moments to fade into Lethe so that others might flourish in Elysium.
As the full weight of his choice's consequences settled upon him like Atlas' burden, understanding crashed through him like Zeus' thunderbolt – a kenosis that was simultaneously emptying and filling. The hybris of the Nexarchs – his own hubris – lay naked before him: they had sought to be Moirai, weaving the threads of time, when they were meant to be nothing more than hierophants, reading the patterns already written in reality's lexicon. Their preservation of moments was not sophia but pleonexia, a greedy hoarding of time itself, each saved instant like a stolen pomegranate seed binding Persephone to the underworld of what -should-not-be.
The Temporum's viridian light transmuted to aureate brilliance, an alchemical transformation that mirrored his own. He was becoming something both more and less than Tempolith VII, Pontifex of Temporal Cartography. Each persona he had worn – the ambitious apprentice, the determined scholar, the proud master – deliquesced like wax beneath Helios' regard. What remained was not the stripped ego of a failed god, but something more akin to Tiresias – cursed with knowledge, blessed with understanding, caught between states of being like Hermaphroditus in Salmacis' pool.
Around him, the theorems and formulae that had been his life's work began to deliquesce, their elegant proofs revealing themselves as elaborate sophistry. The mathematics of time was not wrong, but their interpretation had been hubristic – like Daedalus crafting wings of wax and feathers, they had built beautiful tools while misunderstanding the fundamental nature of their enterprise. Time was not a medium to be manipulated but a mysterium to be witnessed, not a text to be edited but a sacred script to be read with trembling reverence.
The necropolis of preserved moments beneath Neo-Alexandria now revealed itself as a kind of temporal tumulus, not an archive but a tomb where the natural entropy of time was denied its sacred role. Each rescued moment, each preserved timeline was like an embalmed pharaoh surrounded by grave goods – beautiful, intact, but fundamentally an offense against the natural order. Like Ozymandias' works, they would inevitably crumble, and their fall would be all the more catastrophic for having been delayed.

His metamorphosis reached its apex, and with it came a revelation that broke through him like Apollo's arrows piercing the python of ignorance. The role of the Nexarchs should never have been preservation but observation, not mastery but understanding. They were meant to be witnesses to time's flow, kartographers of its currents, but never its masters. Like Orpheus learning that love meant letting go, he understood that true temporal wisdom lay not in holding on but in accepting the necessity of loss.
As the gnosis settled into his bones like Pythia's vapors, the weight of necessary action began to crystallize. It settled upon him like Atlas' burden, a pondus both terrible and clarifying. The necropolis beneath Neo-Alexandria – that vast repository of preserved moments, that labyrinth of temporal fragments – would need to be unmade. Not destroyed, for destruction was merely another form of hybris, but released, allowed to fade like Eurydice returning to the shadows, each moment finding its natural place in time's flow. The process would require precision, a surgeon's care rather than a warrior's strength, lest the unraveling of preserved timelines create new fractures in reality's already strained fabric.
He would begin with the primal wound, his own intervention in Cassandra's timeline. The correction must be uncorrected, not with violence but with grace, like Ariadne's thread being gently withdrawn from the maze. The paradox was exquisite: to preserve time's integrity, he must allow the preservation of a life to be undone. Cassandra's research, her school of temporal archaeology, all the branches that had grown from that single preserved moment – they would need to deliquesce like morning mist before Helios' rise, returning to the realm of potentia rather than actuality.
The Temporum's light shifted in response to his resolve, its patterns forming a cartographic representation of the task ahead. Each preserved moment appeared as a nexus of golden threads in the temporal weave, points where their intervention had created artificial nodes in time's natural flow. The mathematics of temporal release revealed themselves not in equations but in patterns, like the sacred geometry of temple architects translated into the architecture of time itself. He would need to identify the loadbearing moments, the key points where their preservations had created the greatest strain and begin there.
Dawn's first light pierced the Temporum's aureate glow like Helios' spear through Nyx's veil, marking the transition from revelation to action. Tempolith descended the spiral stairs of the Obsidian Clocktower, each step a katabasis into responsibility, into the realm where abstract understanding must crystallize into deed. The necropolis beneath waited, its preserved moments humming with artificial life, like Galatea before Pygmalion's touch – beautiful, but fundamentally false.
The temporal engines thrummed with daemonic energy, their geometries maintaining countless preserved moments in precarious stasis. Before him spread the Engine Room's vast temenos, its architectonic complexity a testament to their hubris – copper conduits wrapped like Laocöon's serpents around crystalline cores, each chronolith pulsing with captive time. Here, in this sanctum of technological hybris, the Nexarchs had built their own Babel, attempting to reach into time's higher dimensions through sheer mechanical will.
He approached the master control plinth, its surface etched with Euclidean patterns that encoded the fundamental equations of temporal preservation. The shutdown sequence was not written in any manual – such knowledge was passed from hierophant to hierophant through the generations, a mysterium wrapped in ritual and obligation. His fingers traced the first sigils, each touch releasing microscopic charges of temporal energy, like Orpheus plucking the strings of his lyre before descending to the underworld.
"I thought I might find you here."
Cassandra's voice carried no accusation, only a profound melancholy that echoed the weight of necessity. She stood in the doorway like Athena at her temple's threshold, her researcher's robes flowing with an almost liquid grace. The anagnorisis in her eyes told him she already understood, at least in part. She was, after all, a hierophant of temporal theory in her own right.
"You've seen it too, haven't you?" he asked, his hands still resting on the plinth. "The fractures in the continuum, the way our preserved moments strain against reality's fabric."
She crossed the room like Moira approaching her loom. "I've been studying the degradation patterns for months. The mathematics are unambiguous – we're approaching a critical threshold of temporal stability. But I never understood why until now." She gestured at the engines, their light reflecting in her eyes. "We're not preserving time, are we? We're mummifying it, preventing its natural metamorphosis."
Her understanding was a gift, like Ariadne offering her thread freely rather than requiring it to be taken. Together they stood before the control plinth, hierophant, and hierophant, each carrying a piece of the necessary truth. The shutdown sequence would require both their knowledge – his understanding of the preservation mechanisms, her expertise in temporal archaeology. It was fitting, perhaps even necessary, that she who had been saved would help orchestrate this first step toward restoration.
In the days that followed, the first chronolith's dimming light became a catalyst, its effects spreading through Neo-Alexandria like ripples in Poseidon's sea. The city began to metamorphose like Daphne transformed by Apollo's touch – not a violent change but a gradual, inexorable becoming. The city's temporal architecture, those overlapping strata of preserved moments that had given it its distinctive chiaroscuro of ages, began to settle into more natural patterns. Gothic spires no longer strained against chrome ziggurats in impossible configurations; instead, they began to find their proper places in time's flow, like sediment settling in Tempolith' stream.
The effects manifested first in the necropolis beneath the city, where the released chronolith's absence created ripples of adjustment through the temporal preservation matrix. Other preserved moments began to shift and strain, like Antaeus losing contact with the earth, their artificial anchors weakening as reality sought its natural configuration. The Nexarchs' acolytes reported strange phenomena: phantom architectures appearing and dissolving like Proteus' forms, echoes of unrealized futures fading like Eurydice's shade, the very air thrumming with the music of temporal readjustment.
In the Grand Archive, ancient texts began to palimpsest themselves, their contents shifting as the preserved knowledge they contained sought its proper place in time's stream. The Lexicon itself – that vast repository of temporal theory and observation – was transforming, its pages no longer attempts to catalog and control time but becoming instead a living record of time's own patterns, like Sibylline leaves arranging themselves into new meanings. The Archivists, those resolute hierophants of temporal knowledge, found themselves becoming not preservers but witnesses, their role shifting from maintenance to observation.
As the season of change deepened like Persephone's descent, Neo-Alexandria found its new rhythm, a harmonia not imposed but discovered. The Obsidian Clocktower still rose above the city like a gnomon casting truth's shadow, but its purpose had fundamentally transformed. Where once it had been a fortress of temporal control, it now stood as a temenos of temporal wisdom, its halls filled not with the hum of preservation engines but with the subtle music of time's natural flow.
In the transformed Archive, Tempolith and Cassandra worked to create a new codex, not of preservation techniques but of temporal observation. The mathematics remained elegant but served a different purpose – not to cage time's flow but to describe its inherent patterns, like Pythagoras discovering the ratios in nature rather than imposing them. Their equations became poetry, their observations a form of reverence, each formula acknowledging the profound mysterium of temporal reality.
The last chronolith in the depths of the necropolis pulsed with diminishing light, like Hesperus yielding to dawn. Around it gathered the Nexarchs, no longer masters but students, to witness this final release. Cassandra stepped forward, her role coming full circle, to initiate the shutdown sequence. As the light faded, the assembled witnesses felt not loss but completion, like Orpheus finally understanding why he had to let Eurydice go.
"Look," she whispered, pointing to where the chronolith's energy had been.
In its place, visible to their trained eyes, flowed time's natural currents, complex patterns that had always existed beneath their artificial preservations. Like the Moirai's weaving seen in its entirety, these patterns revealed a deeper order, an inherent wisdom that needed no human intervention. The Nexarchs' new instruments – devices for observation rather than control – recorded these patterns with reverent precision, each measurement a step toward understanding rather than mastery.
Above, Neo-Alexandria continued its gradual transformation. The city's architecture settled into natural chronological layers, like geological strata finding their proper place. The preserved moments that had given the city its distinctive character didn't simply vanish – they left traces, echoes that enriched rather than distorted the temporal fabric. Like Mnemosyne's gift properly understood, these memories became part of the city's natural history rather than imposed anachronisms.
In the highest chamber of the Obsidian Clocktower, Tempolith stood before the great window that had witnessed his transformation. The city below was both different and the same, like Theseus' ship rebuilt with understanding rather than mere wood. The Temporum's light, no longer a swirling maelstrom of preserved time, had settled into a steady aurora of natural temporal flow, its patterns revealing rather than imposing meaning.
"We begin again," he murmured, though he was no longer the same 'we' who had stood in this spot before his katabasis into understanding. The Nexarchs would continue their work, but as hierophants of time's mysteries rather than its would-be rulers. Their power now lay not in preservation but in perception, not in control but in comprehension.
The sun rose over Neo-Alexandria, its light falling on a city that had found its proper place in time's flow. The Echoes that had haunted Tempolith were quiet now, not silenced but transformed into understanding. Like Tiresias after his transformation, he had lost one kind of sight to gain another. The Lexicon of Time remained, but it had become something else – not a manual of control but a testament to wonder, its pages recording not how to preserve moments but how to witness them with wisdom and grace.
In the end, it was not an ending at all, but a return to the natural order, like a river finding its true course. The Nexarchs' magnificent work had not been preservation but the journey to this understanding: that time itself was the true master, and their highest calling was to witness its flow with humble wisdom. Like Heraclitus' river, they could never preserve the same moment twice – but they could learn to read the patterns in its endless flow, finding meaning not in stasis but in change itself.
