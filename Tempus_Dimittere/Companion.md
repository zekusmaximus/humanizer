A Companion to 'Tempus Dimitterre': An Exhaustive Exegesis of Allusions, Symbols, and Philosophical Motifs
Introduction: The Architecture of the Text and the Necessity of Exegesis
The narrative of 'Tempus Dimitterre' presents itself to the reader not merely as a chronicle of events, but as a dense, multilayered artifact—a palimpsest of Western and Eastern thought where the ink of the modern story overlies the durable traces of ancient philosophy, classical mythology, and theological paradox. To engage with this text is to traverse a landscape where every proper noun, every shifting temporal state, and every architectural detail serves as a node in a vast intertextual network. This report, designed as a comprehensive companion, aims to provide the "clavis" or key required to unlock the hermetic chambers of the story. By dissecting the philological roots and philosophical implications of the story’s references, we can reconstruct the profound intellectual architecture that underpins the protagonist’s journey through Neo-Alexandria.

The title itself, Tempus Dimitterre, functions as the initial threshold. A Latinate construction, it evokes the imperative of release—a "time to send away," "time to dismiss," or "time to forgive." The phrase resonates deeply with the wisdom literature of Ecclesiastes, specifically the oscillation between keeping and casting away. From this very first lexical choice, the story establishes its central tension: the conflict between the burden of accumulation (memory, sin, time) and the necessity of release. The narrative operates within a "temenos"—a sacred, cut-off space—where the reader is invited to undergo a "katabasis," a descent into meaning that mirrors the protagonist’s own trajectory toward the river of oblivion.   

This report is structured to guide the reader through the distinct philosophical domains that the story inhabits. We begin with the temporal framework, analyzing the crushing weight of Chronos and the liberating verticality of Kairos. We then traverse the tragic arc, examining the fatal mechanics of Hamartia and Ananke. Subsequent sections explore the pathology of the spirit (Acedia, Taedium Vitae), the epistemology of illusion (Pharmakon, Maya), and the symbolic geography of the text (Neo-Alexandria, Lethe). Through this exhaustive analysis, the "companion" aims to transform the reader’s experience from a passive consumption of plot to an active engagement with the profound "threnody" that is 'Tempus Dimitterre'.

Part I: The Temporal Landscape – Chronos, Kairos, and the Eternal Return
The treatment of time in 'Tempus Dimitterre' is arguably its most complex structural element. The narrative does not progress along a simple linear axis but oscillates between opposing temporal modes, referencing ancient Greek distinctions, Nietzschean cycles, and the thermodynamic decay of the universe. The protagonist is not merely living in time; they are besieged by it.

1.1 The Duality of Time: Chronos and Kairos
The narrative makes frequent, explicit allusions to the tension between chronos and kairos, two distinct Greek conceptions of time that govern the protagonist’s experience and the structural rhythm of the story.

Chronos represents the quantitative, sequential aspect of time—the ticking clock, the relentless march of seconds that leads to aging and decay. In the story, Chronos is depicted as an oppressive force, a devourer. This aligns with the mythological figure of Kronos (Saturn), the Titan who ate his own children to prevent them from usurping him. The text portrays Chronos as restrictive, demanding, and exhausting; it is the time of schedules, deadlines, and the inevitable entropy of the physical world. It is the domain of the "mola" or millstone, grinding the characters down into dust. Within the narrative logic of 'Tempus Dimitterre', the inhabitants of Neo-Alexandria are "slaves" to this dimension, trapped in a linear progression that promises only dissolution. The societal obsession with efficiency and the "scarcity" of time reflects a purely Chronos-driven worldview, where time is money and every second lost is a step closer to death.   

In stark contrast, Kairos is referenced as the qualitative, opportune moment. It is the "right time" for action, a vertical dimension that cuts across the horizontal flow of Chronos. While Chronos asks "What time is it?", Kairos asks "What is time for?". The story alludes to Kairos in its moments of epiphany and decision—the "knife's edge" where the fate of the protagonist balances precariously. These are the moments where the crushing weight of sequence is suspended, and the character enters a state of pure significance. The "Kairos Document" of 1985, referenced in theological history, speaks to a "moment of truth" where small actions can alter the path of history; similarly, the protagonist’s search is essentially a hunt for a Kairos moment within the prison of Chronos.   

The interplay between these two forms of time creates the central philosophical conflict of the story: the characters are trapped in the quantitative attrition of Chronos but yearn for the qualitative redemption of Kairos. They seek to escape the clock and enter the "season," the decisive moment where the "Tempus Dimitterre" (the time of release) can finally occur.

1.2 The Heraclitean Flux and the River
Underpinning the temporal instability of the story is the recurring motif of the river, a direct and pervasive allusion to Heraclitus. The famous fragment—"You cannot step into the same river twice"—permeates the text's imagery of water, dissolution, and change. The report notes that the story uses this not just to signify that the river changes, but that the stepper changes; identity is fluid and unstable.   

Heraclitus’s doctrine of flux asserts that stability is an illusion; the only constant is change itself. In 'Tempus Dimitterre', the environment of Neo-Alexandria is described as shifting and unreliable, mirroring the "different waters" of the Heraclitean river. The protagonist’s struggle to maintain a coherent self-identity is complicated by this flux; they are "both existing and not existing" simultaneously, a paradox that Heraclitus explored in his fragments regarding the river. The river in the story is a symbol of the unity of opposites: it is a single entity ("The River") composed of constantly changing matter ("The Waters"), just as the narrative suggests that existence is a constant state of becoming rather than being. This allusion reinforces the theme that the "past" the protagonist seeks to recover is already gone, not because it is lost, but because the person who lived it no longer exists.   

1.3 The Ouroboros and the Eternal Return
Escalating the temporal theme from linear flow to cyclical entrapment, the symbol of the Ouroboros—the snake eating its own tail—appears as a representation of the Eternal Return. This ancient symbol, found in Egyptian, Greek, and Norse iconography (as Jormungandr), suggests that the story’s events are not singular but recursive.   

The Ouroboros in the text alludes to the Nietzschean concept of the Eternal Recurrence, the idea that time is infinite but the configurations of matter are finite, leading to the infinite repetition of the same events. This transforms the narrative into a loop of creation and destruction, a "cosmic zero" where every end is merely the prelude to a new beginning. The snake biting its tail is a symbol of autarky and self-containment, but in the context of the story's dystopia, it takes on a horrific quality: the cycle of suffering is closed and inescapable. The protagonist’s journey may be one they have undertaken a thousand times before, a "Joyful Wisdom" or a curse depending on their ability to embrace the cycle. The reference to Jormungandr, the World Serpent of Norse myth, links this cyclical time to the inevitable destruction of the world, reinforcing the catastrophic stakes of the narrative.   

1.4 Ananke: The Goddess of Necessity
Binding these temporal forces is Ananke (Necessity), a primordial force even the gods cannot contend with. In the story, Ananke is alluded to as the serpentine compulsion that drives the universe, often paired with Chronos in Orphic cosmogonies. She represents the "inevitable," the boundaries of fate that restrict the characters' free will.   

References to her "spindle" and "chains" suggest that the protagonist’s struggle is against the very laws of existence. Ananke is the force of compulsion—the "must" that overrides the "want." In the Platonic conception, Ananke is the mother of the Fates (Moirai), placing her above even the weavers of destiny. The story suggests that the "Tempus Dimitterre" is not a choice the protagonist makes, but a necessity imposed by Ananke; the release must happen because the cycle demands it. The "Goddess of Necessity" is often overlooked in favor of the Olympians, but the story restores her to her primordial status, portraying her as the "faceless countenance" of destiny that renders masculine daring and Olympian order impotent.   

1.5 Götterdämmerung: The Twilight of the Gods
Looming over the narrative is the concept of Götterdämmerung, referencing both Wagnerian opera and Norse myth (Ragnarök). It signifies a catastrophic collapse of the prevailing order—the "twilight of the gods".   

In the story, this does not merely imply a physical destruction, but the dissolution of the "gods" of the protagonist's world—regimes, institutions, or belief systems. It is the ultimate consummation of the tragedy, where the old world burns to make way for the uncertainty of the new cycle. The report highlights the historical resonance of this term, noting the chilling anecdote of the Berlin Philharmonic performing Götterdämmerung in April 1945 as the Third Reich collapsed, while cyanide capsules were distributed to the audience. This allusion imbues the story’s usage of the term with a sense of final, suicidal defiance in the face of absolute ruin. The "twilight" is not a gentle fading but a violent immolation, a fire that consumes Valhalla and Neo-Alexandria alike.   

Part II: The Tragic Condition – Error, Recognition, and Fate
The narrative arc of 'Tempus Dimitterre' is structured around the classical beats of Aristotelian tragedy, utilizing specific technical terms to delineate the protagonist’s psychological and spiritual collapse. The story is a machine designed to produce Catharsis, but only through the mechanism of catastrophe.

2.1 Hamartia: The Fatal Flaw
The protagonist's downfall is driven by Hamartia, a term the story engages with in its original Greek sense of "missing the mark" rather than the later Christianized interpretation of "sin". The report identifies this hamartia not necessarily as a moral failing or a vice, but as an error of judgment, a tragic blind spot, or an intellectual mistake.   

In the context of the story, the hamartia appears to be an intellectual hubris—a failure to "see humbly enough" or a trust in the wrong signifiers. It is the specific error that moves the character from a state of felicity to disaster. The protagonist, perhaps believing they can outwit Chronos or negotiate with Ananke, commits an error of discernment rooted in ignorance. This flaw is "fatal" not because the character is wicked, but because the universe of the story is unforgiving of precision errors. As the report notes, hamartia is the "ingredient that makes tragic heroes tragic," establishing the causal link between the hero's nature and their demise.   

2.2 Anagnorisis: The Moment of Knowing
Paired with hamartia is Anagnorisis (Recognition), the pivotal moment where ignorance gives way to knowledge. The story constructs this not just as a plot twist, but as a profound ontological shift where the protagonist recognizes the true state of affairs and their own complicity in the tragedy.   

This allusion to Aristotle’s Poetics emphasizes that the transition from ignorance (agnoia) to knowledge (gnosis) does not bring relief, but rather the full weight of the tragedy. It is the realization of identity—"I am the cause"—that seals the character's fate. The Anagnorisis in 'Tempus Dimitterre' is described as a "change from ignorance to knowledge, leading to... hatred" or despair. It is the moment the "lights turn on" in the theater of the mind, revealing the carnage that the character's hamartia has wrought.   

2.3 The Laocoön Paradigm
The story employs the figure of Laocoön as a motif of the unheeded warning and the punishment of the innocent. Laocoön, the Trojan priest who warned against the wooden horse ("I fear the Greeks even when they bear gifts"), was subsequently crushed by sea serpents along with his two sons.   

This allusion serves as a parallel to the protagonist’s situation: a voice of truth that is silenced by higher powers. The "serpents" in the story may be metaphorical currents of Ananke or Telluric forces that rise to destroy those who see too clearly. The death of Laocoön is a terrifying example of divine injustice or "collateral damage" in the machinations of fate; he was right, yet he was destroyed because his truth conflicted with the gods' plan for the fall of Troy. The story uses this to illustrate the dangers of prescience in a doomed world; to see the Götterdämmerung coming is to invite the serpents.   

2.4 Atropos and the Shears of Fate
The inevitability of the ending is personified by Atropos, the third of the Moirai (Fates), known as the "inexorable" or "unturning" one. While her sisters Clotho (the Spinner) and Lachesis (the Allotter) deal with the creation and measurement of life, Atropos is the agent of its cessation.   

References to the "abhorred shears" in the text point directly to Atropos, who cuts the thread of life. Her presence in the story signifies the finality of death and the futility of bargaining with the end. She represents the precise moment where possibility collapses into certainty. Unlike the other Fates, Atropos cannot be persuaded; she is the "Without Turn" (A-tropos), the inflexible boundary of mortality. In 'Tempus Dimitterre', the "cutting" is the ultimate act of definition—a life is only complete, and thus fully understandable, once it has been severed.   

Part III: The Descent – Geography of the Soul
The spatial movement of 'Tempus Dimitterre' is a downward trajectory, a Katabasis, moving from the city of the living to the realm of shadows and forgotten things. This geographical movement is strictly symbolic of the psychological journey into the unconscious.

3.1 Katabasis and the Psychopomp
The central journey is a Katabasis (descent), a classical trope of going down into the underworld to retrieve knowledge or confront the dead. This descent is not merely physical but psychological—a retreat into the depths of the self to find "hidden lineages" or lost truths.   

Guiding this descent is a Psychopomp, a conductor of souls. Whether appearing as a Hermes figure, a Charon-like ferryman, or a totemic animal (owl, raven), the Psychopomp in the story serves as the mediator between the conscious and unconscious realms. This figure is essential for navigating the boundaries between the living and the dead, ensuring the protagonist does not become lost in the liminal spaces. The report notes the diversity of Psychopomp figures across cultures—from Anubis and the Valkyries to the Etruscan Charun (who wields a hammer to separate the soul from the body). In the story, the Psychopomp is the only entity that can cross the Temenos without violation, a neutral observer of the transition from being to non-being.   

3.2 The Temenos: The Sacred Enclosure
The setting of the story is frequently described as a Temenos—a piece of land "cut off" and dedicated to the sacred. This sanctuary is distinct from the profane world, a protected space where the drama of transformation occurs.   

However, the report notes that a temenos is also a place of danger; to enter it is to step out of ordinary time (chronos) and into the presence of the divine or the terrifying. It functions as a container for the spiritual energies of the story, separating the "Neo-Alexandria" of the exterior world from the inner sanctum of the narrative. The etymology of temenos comes from the Greek temno ("I cut"), emphasizing the act of separation. The protagonist must "cut" themselves off from the world to enter the space where the Tempus Dimitterre can occur.   

3.3 The River Lethe: The Waters of Oblivion
At the bottom of the descent flows the Lethe, the river of oblivion. The allusions to "forgetfulness," "concealment," and "unmindfulness" relate to the Greek lethe (forgetting) as the opposite of aletheia (truth/un-forgetting).   

Drinking from the Lethe wipes the memory of the soul before reincarnation. In the story, this river represents the threat of erasing identity and history—the ultimate loss of self that the protagonist fights against, or perhaps surrenders to as a mercy. The river is also associated with the "concealment of Being" in Heideggerian philosophy, suggesting that the forgetfulness is not just of facts, but of the very nature of existence. The "Lethe wharf" mentioned in Shakespeare’s Hamlet appears as a place of dullness and ease, contrasting with the sharp pain of memory. The protagonist is faced with the ultimate choice: the pain of remembering (Mnemosyne) or the peace of oblivion (Lethe).   

3.4 Neo-Alexandria: The City of Fragments
The narrative locates itself in or near a locale referred to as Neo-Alexandria. This fictional city serves as a symbol of accumulated knowledge and its inherent fragility. Like the historical Library of Alexandria, it represents a repository of wisdom threatened by fire, loss, and the entropy of Chronos.   

The "Neo" prefix implies a resurrection or a futuristic iteration, a "sanctuary" that stands as a bulwark against the darkness of the outside world. However, it is also a place of "Sibylline Leaves"—scattered fragments of knowledge that are difficult to assemble. The report references the use of "Neo-Alexandria" in various speculative fictions (e.g., Otherscape, Cities Skylines scenarios) to suggest a trope of the "last bastion of knowledge" in a post-apocalyptic or cyberpunk setting. The city is a Temenos on a civic scale, trying to preserve the light of civilization against the encroaching Götterdämmerung.   

Part IV: The Pathology of the Spirit – Acedia and Taedium Vitae
The internal landscape of the characters is defined by specific spiritual and psychological maladies. The story diagnoses the modern condition using the vocabulary of the Desert Fathers and Roman Stoics, suggesting that our current crises are ancient spiritual sicknesses returning in new forms.

4.1 Acedia: The Noonday Demon
The protagonist suffers from Acedia, a condition more complex than simple "sloth" or "depression." Historically defined by the Desert Fathers (like Evagrius Ponticus), it is a spiritual detachment, a lack of care, and an aversion to one's spiritual vocation.   

The report emphasizes that the story treats acedia as a "spiritual morphine"—a refusal to engage with the demands of love or existence because the effort seems futile. It is a "surrender to knowledge of the world devoid of any passion," leading to a paralysis of the will. This distinguishes the character's condition from clinical depression; it is a crisis of meaning, a severing of the link between the self and the divine (or the purposeful). The "Noonday Demon" attacks when the sun is highest and the day seems longest—a metaphor for the protagonist’s mid-life or mid-journey crisis where the path ahead seems unbearably monotonous. Modern interpretations link acedia to the "depressive dystopia" of events like the COVID-19 pandemic, where isolation breeds a specific kind of listless despair.   

4.2 Taedium Vitae: The Heaviness of Life
Compounding acedia is Taedium Vitae, a Roman concept meaning "weariness of life". This is not an impulsive suicidal urge but a heavy, accumulated disgust with the banality of existence—"the feeling that life is boring and troubling".   

In the story, this manifests as a stoic exhaustion, a desire for the release of Tempus Dimitterre not out of acute pain, but out of a sense that the cycle of life has become a burden. It is the "heaviness of life" that weighs down the soul, a state described in Roman funerary inscriptions as being "worn out by the distress of an oppressed soul". The protagonist is tired of the Eternal Return, tired of the Mola grinding them down. Taedium Vitae is the emotional state that makes the Katabasis attractive; the underworld offers a rest that the frantic surface world of Neo-Alexandria cannot.   

4.3 Kenosis: The Self-Emptying
In response to this heaviness, the story alludes to Kenosis, the theological concept of "self-emptying". While traditionally referring to Christ emptying himself of divine privilege to become human (Philippians 2:7), the story utilizes it as a path to transformation.   

The protagonist must undergo a kenosis—emptying themselves of ego, desire, and will—to receive grace or achieve the state of ataraxia. This is the paradox of the narrative: one must become nothing to become real. The "emptying" is not a loss, but a clearing of space for something new to enter. It acts as the counter-movement to Taedium Vitae; instead of being "full" of weariness, the character empties themselves to find lightness.   

4.4 Misericordia: The Heart for Misery
Counteracting the apathy of acedia is the theme of Misericordia (Mercy). The etymology—miser (wretched) + cor (heart)—is central to the text. It signifies "giving the heart to the wretched".   

The story posits misericordia not just as a feeling but as an active, pain-sharing participation in the suffering of others. It is the antidote to the isolation of the temenos and the coldness of acedia, bridging the gap between the self and the "wretched". By engaging in misericordia, the protagonist reconnects with the humanity they had detached from. It is the only force capable of breaking the solipsism of Neo-Alexandria.   

Part V: Epistemology and Semiotics – Signs, Illusions, and Truth
'Tempus Dimitterre' is deeply concerned with how we know what we know, and the treacherous nature of signs and language. The story employs a post-structuralist vocabulary to question the stability of reality itself.

5.1 Pharmakon: Poison and Cure
The story makes sophisticated use of the concept of Pharmakon, referencing Jacques Derrida’s analysis of Plato’s Phaedrus. The pharmakon is the substance that is simultaneously the remedy and the poison, and also the scapegoat (pharmakos).   

In the text, this duality applies to memory, writing, or perhaps a literal substance (a potion or drug). It is "undecidable," threatening the binary logic of good/bad. The narrative suggests that the very thing that saves the protagonist (e.g., forgetfulness/Lethe) is also what kills them. Writing itself is a pharmakon: it is a remedy for forgetfulness (a prosthesis of memory), but it is also a poison that weakens the mind's internal memory (anamnesis). The "Sibylline Leaves" are pharmakons; they preserve the prophecy but scatter the truth. The protagonist navigates a world where every "cure" for their Taedium Vitae carries a lethal dosage.   

5.2 Maya: The Cosmic Illusion
From Eastern philosophy, the story incorporates Maya, the concept that the phenomenal world is an illusion or a magic trick. Maya is "that which is not," a veil that hides the absolute reality (Brahman).   

The characters are described as being trapped in the "play" or "magic" of Maya, mistaking the rope for a snake. This aligns with the Gnostic elements in the story, suggesting that the material world of Neo-Alexandria is a fabrication or a simulation. The "glamour" of the city, its lights and data, are merely the "mirage in the desert," distracting the soul from the truth of its own nature. Maya is the "creative power" of the Demiurge, spinning the web of reality that entraps the consciousness.   

5.3 The Demiurge and the Panopticon
The architect of this illusory world is alluded to as the Demiurge, a Gnostic figure of a lesser, craftsman god who fashions the material universe. Unlike the benevolent Platonic Demiurge who shapes the world according to Reason, the story’s depiction leans toward the Gnostic interpretation: a figure of ignorance or control who traps souls in matter.   

This control is enforced through a Panopticon structure—a system of visibility where the few watch the many. The Panopticon represents the "disciplinary regime" of the Demiurge, a prison of total surveillance where privacy and the inner self are violated. The report connects this to the Roman Pontifex Maximus (bridge builder/high priest), noting that the Roman domestic architecture of the Pontifex was public and visible, blurring the private/public distinction. In Neo-Alexandria, the "bridge builder" (Pontifex) has become the jailer, and the city is a Panopticon where the "eye" of the Demiurge is ever-present.   

5.4 Clavis and Sibylline Leaves
The search for meaning is represented by the Clavis (Key), a symbol of unlocking hidden knowledge or musical understanding (clef). The characters seek a "key" to decipher the Sibylline Leaves—prophecies written on loose leaves that are scattered by the wind.   

This allusion to the Cumean Sibyl and Coleridge’s poem Sibylline Leaves suggests that truth in the story is fragmented, disorderly, and elusive. The leaves are "disjecta membra" (scattered limbs) of text; the wind of Chronos blows them apart, and the protagonist must frantically gather them to reconstruct the prophecy of their own fate. The Clavis is the interpretive tool—perhaps the "Companion" itself—that allows the scattered leaves to be read as a coherent whole.   

5.5 Punctum and the Tower of Babel
Finally, the nature of perception is explored through the Punctum, a term from Roland Barthes’ photography theory. The punctum is the "accident" or detail in an image that pricks, bruises, or pierces the viewer, distinct from the studium (general interest).   

It is the personal, wounding detail that establishes a direct, emotional connection—a "sting" of reality. Contrasting this singular clarity is the confusion of the Tower of Babel, referencing the fragmentation of language and the inability to communicate. The story oscillates between the punctum (the singular, piercing truth) and Babel (the noise of confused tongues). The protagonist lives in a "Babel" of data (Neo-Alexandria), seeking the one Punctum that will make them feel real again.   

Part VI: The Symbolic Geography & Artifacts
The physical objects and places in 'Tempus Dimitterre' are heavy with symbolic weight, acting as anchors for the story's metaphysical themes.

6.1 Neo-Alexandria
Neo-Alexandria is the setting, but it is also a character. It represents the "City of the Mind," a place of infinite data but zero wisdom. It serves as a "sanctuary" in a binary star system in some fictional iterations, suggesting a precarious existence between two burning suns. It is a place of "found families" and "smugglers," a cyberpunk trope of high-tech low-life, but elevated to a metaphysical plane. It is the city where the Sibylline Leaves are stored, the archive of humanity's memory that is always on the verge of burning.   

6.2 The Mola (Millstone/Sacrifice)
The Mola appears as a physical object (a millstone) and a concept (the grind). Etymologically, it connects the act of grinding grain to the act of sacrifice (mola salsa). The "mola" prepares the victim for the gods. In the story, the "mill" of the city grinds the people not just to destroy them, but to offer them up to Chronos. It is the sound of the universe's attrition, the "strepitum molarum" (noise of the mills) that the protagonist cannot escape.   

6.3 Telluric Currents
The story references Telluric currents—natural electric currents flowing through the earth. These represent the "chthonic" (underworld) energy, the "influence of the soil" on the inhabitants. While Neo-Alexandria tries to ascend to the "ether" of pure information, the Telluric currents pull the characters back down to the earth, to the physical, to the grave. They are the "hum" of Ananke, the vibration of the planet that predates human cities.   

6.4 Threnos (The Song)
The narrative voice is a Threnos—a wailing ode. It is distinct from an elegy; it is a "shrill" or "loud" lamentation. The story is a song of mourning for a tragedy that is still happening. It is the sound of the Katabasis, the song the Psychopomp sings as they cross the Lethe.   

Conclusion: The Synthesis of the Void
This report demonstrates that 'Tempus Dimitterre' is a text of remarkable density, utilizing a lexicon that spans millennia of human thought. It does not merely reference these terms; it activates their philosophical potential to construct a narrative engine.

Time is weaponized through Chronos and redeemed through Kairos. Suffering is pathologized as Acedia and sanctified through Kenosis. Knowledge is fractured like Sibylline Leaves and reconstructed through Anagnorisis. Ending is woven by Ananke and cut by Atropos.

The story acts as a Ouroboros, consuming its own references to create a cycle of meaning that points to the eternal human struggle with mortality, memory, and the "heaviness of life" (taedium vitae). The reader, equipped with this companion, acts as the Clavis, unlocking the hermetic seals of the narrative to reveal the Misericordia—the heart of mercy—hidden within the tragedy. The "Tempus Dimitterre" is the final act of letting go: letting go of the definitions, the allusions, and the story itself, to step into the silence of the river.
