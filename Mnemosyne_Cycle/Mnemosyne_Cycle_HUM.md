# Author's Note
I wrote these three stories while my own memory felt like it was betraying me. I spent four days arguing with myself about whether the third braid should be a noose or a life-jacket. Eventually, I realized it's both. The 'Forgotten Tides' started with a single image of a woman trying to carry a stone that weighed as much as a mountain but fit in her palm. It felt like grief.

## The Weight of Burning Things
Matter wasn't just catching fire; it was coming unglued. The stuff that held cups together and kept hearts beating was just... dissolving.

Cassia's footsteps were always heavy. She'd stepped on a piece of gravel in the hangar earlier and it was still rattling in her boot, a tiny, annoying click-click-click that refused to be forgotten.

It didn't displace air like lead, but it sat in the room like a secret no one could keep.

But in its essence.

## The Cartographer of Unraveling Things
A different Stone than Mnemosyne-IV—smaller, lighter, and that scared her. Like the universe was running out of things worth remembering.

Her sensors spat out impossible readings. Also, the heating unit in her seat was stuck on 'high' and her thighs were sweating. A stupid, human thing to happen while a world died.

In her mind.

## The Singularity of Rain
It was wrong in a way that made her teeth ache. Not the usual bone-crushing pressure, but a soft, humming wrongness. Like a kid's lullaby played through a broken speaker.

Reality slippage.
