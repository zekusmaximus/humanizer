# Emotional Intensity and Sensory Grounding Analysis

## Objective
Ensure emotional beats feel earned, embodied, and varied rather than labeled or clinical.

## Inputs
- Scene map with stakes from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Passages marking highs (conflict, revelation) and lows (quiet reflection).

## Steps
1. **Label Sweep**
   - Flag emotion labels (angry, sad, anxious) that lack physical or sensory accompaniment.
2. **Embodiment**
   - Add bodily cues (breath, temperature, muscle tension), sensory details (sound, texture, smell), and micro-behaviors specific to the character.
3. **Rhythm Matching**
   - Tighten sentence length and verbs during spikes; allow longer, more contemplative lines during aftermath.
4. **Avoid Melodrama**
   - Swap exaggerated modifiers for concrete observations; align intensity with stakes.

## Deliverables
- List of flat emotional statements with embodied rewrites.
- Rhythm adjustments for key scenes.
- Guidance on each major character’s default and stress responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Emotional moments show change in body/setting, not only labels.
- Intensity calibrates to stakes and character disposition.
- Rewrites maintain POV/tense and avoid cliché reactions.
