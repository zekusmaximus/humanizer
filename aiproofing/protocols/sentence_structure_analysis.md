# Sentence Structure Analysis

## Objective
Break repetitive cadences and increase syntactic variety without losing clarity or voice.

## Inputs
- Sentence-length histogram and opening-pattern data from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Selected passages representative of calm, active, and emotional scenes.

## Steps
1. **Cadence Audit**
   - Identify the top 3 recurring openings (e.g., "He [verb]", "There was", participial lead-ins). Limit any single pattern to <25% per page.
2. **Length Variation**
   - Ensure each section mixes short (<10 words), medium (10–20), long (20–35), and very long (>35) sentences. Add breathless fragments to high-intensity moments only.
3. **Clause Reordering**
   - Rotate dependent/independent clause order; vary conjunctions; use inversion or fronted adverbials sparingly for emphasis.
4. **Dialogue/Narration Balance**
   - Check dialogue tags and beats for repetition. Replace repeated "said" frames with action beats or silence when voice makes speaker obvious.

## Deliverables
- Count of dominant patterns with proposed rewrites to diversify.
- Revised snippets demonstrating varied rhythm tailored to scene mood.
- Notes on patterns intentionally retained for stylistic effect.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No single opening pattern dominates a page.
- Rhythm shifts align with scene intensity (longer for reflection, shorter for urgency).
- Rewrites remain faithful to POV/tense and preserve clarity.
