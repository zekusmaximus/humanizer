# Metaphor and Figurative Language Analysis

## Objective
Replace generic or clichéd figurative language with vivid, setting-specific imagery.

## Inputs
- Setting signal list from **manuscript_analysis.md** (objects, locales, era markers).
- Voice profiles from **character_voice_analysis.md**.

## Steps
1. **Cliché Sweep**
   - Identify common metaphors/similes ("like clockwork", "cold as ice", "heart of stone"). Mark them for replacement.
2. **Source Domain Selection**
   - Build fresh source domains from setting signals (tools, food, weather, technology, fauna) and align them with voices.
3. **Consistency and Restraint**
   - Limit extended metaphors to one at a time; ensure metaphors suit POV knowledge and education level.
4. **Sensory Integration**
   - Favor imagery that triggers multiple senses or reveals character judgment, not just shape comparisons.

## Deliverables
- List of cliché/flat metaphors with replacements tied to setting and voice.
- 3–5 revised passages illustrating stronger figurative language.
- Note any intentional motifs to retain.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Figurative language feels specific to the story world and speaker.
- No reused stock metaphors remain unchallenged.
- Imagery enhances mood or characterization without overshadowing clarity.
