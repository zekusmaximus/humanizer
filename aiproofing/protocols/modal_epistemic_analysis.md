# Modal and Epistemic Nuance Analysis

## Objective
Embed human-like uncertainty, perspective, and subjectivity where appropriate without weakening decisive moments.

## Inputs
- POV/tense and speaker list from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Scene stakes (identify high/low stakes from context).

## Steps
1. **Assertive Statement Sweep**
   - Locate sections dominated by declaratives. Mark areas where characters or narrators would realistically hedge.
2. **Hedging & Subjectivity**
   - Add modals (might, could, would), evidentials (seemed, apparently), and perception verbs tailored to POV.
3. **Decisive Moments**
   - Preserve or sharpen modality during commitments, vows, or irreversible actions.
4. **Internal Thought vs. External Narration**
   - Distinguish between character uncertainty and narrator reliability; align hedging with the correct layer.

## Deliverables
- List of over-assertive sentences with hedged rewrites.
- Notes on scenes where certainty is vital (left unchanged or strengthened).
- 3–5 sample revisions showing balanced modality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Hedging appears where humans naturally express doubt or partial knowledge.
- Critical decisions remain firm; modulation does not sap stakes.
- POV/tense integrity maintained in all rewrites.
