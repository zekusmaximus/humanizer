# Neutral AI Proofing Report — `latent.md`

## Intake & Baseline
- **Length/structure:** 5,376 words across eight scenes separated by em dash breaks (boardroom pitch → train ride → internal investigation → apartment visit → lab confrontation → investor rehearsal → fallout → personal aftermath).
- **POV/tense:** Close third, past tense with present-style immediacy during diagnostic prompts; consistent throughout.
- **Core cast:** Mara (narrator focal point), CEO/CFO/GC/VP Product, Kade (lab), forum poster mother + child, consultant/engineers; setting anchors include Neuro-Co-P HQ boardrooms, subway car, pedestrian overpass, apartment, mock OR lab.
- **Voice/rhythm baseline:** Sentence lengths vary between clipped diagnostics and longer sensory runs; recurrent copper/rail imagery; model readouts in all-caps insert machine cadence.

## Checklist Highlights (from `AIproofcheck.md` + `ai_tell_checklist.md`)
- Watched for formulaic openings and repeated “It…” scaffolding in early exposition.
- Flagged spots where smoothing language risked sounding generic (support interactions, lab description, rehearsal setup).
- Maintained intentional repetition motifs (copper taste, rail grip) as character anchors.

## Category Actions & Edits
- **Vocabulary/idiom refresh:** Added concrete atmospheric details (brake-dust tang in the subway, burnt coffee/croissant in corporate rooms) to localize scenes and break sterile repetition. Inserted colloquial phrasing (“compliance compost”) to roughen corporate diction.
- **Sentence structure variation:** Broke consecutive “It…” openers in the opening boardroom beat to reduce template cadence and foreground embodiment.
- **Sensory grounding & emotional intensity:** Layered bodily sensations (ache in molars, tunnel smell) to reinforce panic/height without leaning on generic descriptors.
- **Formulaic pattern breaking:** Seeded mundane, human clutter (forgotten croissant, dumped coffee) into high-tech environments to disturb pristine lab/boardroom templates.

## Residual Risks & Notes
- Copper/rail and dusk-bridge imagery remain intentionally repetitive as thematic anchors; retain for continuity unless future pacing tests suggest trimming.
- Inner-speech trigger strings and machine readouts are necessary plot devices; ensure any future edits preserve spacing/casing to keep them legible while avoiding chant-like rhythm.
- If additional smoothing remains a concern, next pass could contrast Mara’s narration with dialogue contractions or regional idioms per scene.
