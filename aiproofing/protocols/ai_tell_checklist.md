# AI Tell Checklist (Universal)

Use this list to flag common AI-like signals before or after edits. It is designed for any narrative without custom metadata.

## Structural Tells
- Uniform sentence length or repeated cadence across pages.
- Template paragraph structures (context → action → trailing clause) repeated verbatim.
- Abrupt transitions lacking sensory or temporal anchors.

## Lexical Tells
- Reused mid-frequency adjectives/adverbs (not vivid, flat) clustering in paragraphs.
- Bureaucratic/academic phrasing in intimate or high-action scenes.
- Over-reliance on hedges like "somewhat", "rather", "quite" without voice justification.

## Figurative and Idiom Tells
- Generic metaphors/similes detached from the setting.
- Recycled idioms across multiple characters with different backgrounds.
- Overly balanced comparisons that read like templates ("both X and Y" patterns).

## Voice and Emotion Tells
- Dialogue that matches narrator diction instead of distinct voices.
- Emotional labels without embodied reactions or consequences.
- Sudden tonal shifts that reset to neutrality after intense beats.

## Continuity Tells
- POV or tense drift without signal.
- Inconsistent naming or title usage; unexplained geography shifts.
- Repetitive exposition reintroducing facts the narrative already established.

## Quick Actions
- Break any repeated phrasing runs; diversify openings.
- Add sensory grounding to transitions and emotional peaks.
- Align metaphors and idioms with setting cues gathered from the text itself.
- Retune modality to reflect what the character/narrator can truly know.
