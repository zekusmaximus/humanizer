# Idiomatic Expression Analysis

## Objective
Replace flat or literal phrasing with idiomatic, context-aware language without leaning on clichés.

## Inputs
- Character and setting signals from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Sample idioms inferred from setting/time period (derive from objects, locations, tech level).

## Steps
1. **Literal Phrase Sweep**
   - Flag phrases that read as template descriptions ("in a way", "as if to", "it was like").
2. **Setting-Aligned Idioms**
   - Build 5–10 idiomatic expressions rooted in detected setting signals (e.g., nautical, rural, urban, sci-fi tech) and assign them to narrators/characters.
3. **Voice Matching**
   - Ensure each major speaker uses idioms that fit their education, class, and temperament inferred from diction.
4. **Cliché Replacement**
   - Replace stale idioms with specific, image-rich alternatives linked to the story world.

## Deliverables
- List of flat phrases with proposed idiomatic rewrites.
- Mini idiom bank mapped to top characters/narrators.
- 3 sample rewrites showing idioms in context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Idioms feel native to setting and speaker, not generic.
- No character shares the exact same idiomatic set unless intentionally mirrored.
- Rewrites avoid stock expressions while preserving clarity.
