# Formulaic Pattern Analysis

## Objective
Detect and disrupt templated phrasing that often triggers AI-detection heuristics.

## Inputs
- Opening-pattern list and dialogue tag styles from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Sample of repeated phrases (search for reused 4–8 word strings).

## Steps
1. **N-gram Sweep**
   - Identify recurring 4–8 word sequences; cap any exact repetition to once unless it is a deliberate motif.
2. **Opening Variety**
   - Rotate sentence openings (subject-first, prepositional, participial, question, quoted, onomatopoeia) according to scene needs.
3. **Transition Refresh**
   - Replace stock transitions ("in the end", "as a result", "after a moment") with specific beats tied to setting or character perception.
4. **Template Busting**
   - Rework "X like Y" comparisons, "There was" existentials, and "He/She felt" constructions into more direct or sensory-led phrasing.

## Deliverables
- List of top repeated strings with new variants.
- Rewritten examples showing diversified openings and transitions.
- Motifs documented separately to preserve intentional repetition.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No accidental templates recur enough to flatten voice.
- Transitions feel contextual, not mechanical.
- Motifs are explicitly noted and left intact where purposeful.
