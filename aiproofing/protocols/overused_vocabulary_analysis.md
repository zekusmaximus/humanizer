# Overused and Bureaucratic Vocabulary Analysis

## Objective
Remove AI-like bureaucratic, academic, or generic filler terms and replace them with concrete, voice-specific language.

## Inputs
- Frequency lists from **vocabulary_analysis.md**.
- Voice cues from **manuscript_analysis.md** (formality, slang, sensory focus).

## Steps
1. **Identify Bureaucratic/Abstract Drift**
   - Flag words like: consequently, therefore, significant, pivotal, intricate, nuanced, leveraged, executed, conducted.
2. **Contextualize**
   - Determine if each occurrence is necessary for precision; keep only where required (legal/technical contexts).
3. **Replace with Concrete Actions or Sensory Details**
   - Swap abstract nouns for verbs ("conducted an analysis" → "tested" / "read through").
   - Anchor replacements in setting objects or body reactions where possible.
4. **Voice Alignment**
   - Tailor replacements to speaker voice (formal narrator vs. clipped operative vs. lyrical storyteller).

## Deliverables
- Table of abstract/ bureaucratic terms with suggested replacements.
- 3–5 before/after examples showing improved immediacy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Abstract/bureaucratic density reduced across sections.
- Replacements preserve meaning and suit the established voice.
- Flow improves (fewer stacked prepositional phrases or nominalizations).
