# Consistency and Continuity Check

## Objective
Ensure edits integrate cleanly and that POV, tense, voice, timeline, and terminology remain coherent across the entire file.

## Inputs
- Updated text after category edits.
- Intake maps and voice profiles.

## Steps
1. **POV/Tense Stability**
   - Scan section openings/closings for unintended shifts. Note intentional shifts explicitly.
2. **Name and Term Consistency**
   - Verify character/place names, titles, and key terms stay uniform. Check capitalization and spelling variants.
3. **Timeline and Spatial Coherence**
   - Ensure time jumps and location moves are signaled; check for contradictory durations or distances.
4. **Voice Integration**
   - Confirm new metaphors, idioms, and modality choices match the assigned voices.
5. **Transition Smoothness**
   - Read section joins for abrupt tone or pacing changes; add bridging beats where needed.

## Deliverables
- List of detected inconsistencies with corrections.
- Summary of intentional shifts (POV, tense, motif repetition).
- Final go/no-go recommendation for publication-readiness testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No unresolved contradictions in timeline, location, or naming.
- Voice remains stable after edits.
- Readers can follow scene-to-scene flow without confusion.
