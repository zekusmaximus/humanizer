# Final Analysis and Sign-Off

## Objective
Validate that the AI proofing pass has removed AI-like signals while preserving or enhancing narrative quality.

## Inputs
- Revised manuscript.
- Outputs from all category guides and **consistency_check.md**.

## Steps
1. **Holistic Read-Through**
   - Read continuously; note any passages that feel mechanical, over-smoothed, or newly awkward.
2. **Voice Spot Checks**
   - Sample three distant sections to ensure voices remain identifiable and metaphors stay aligned with setting.
3. **Detection Risk Review**
   - Confirm repetition, template phrasing, and uniform cadence have been addressed; ensure bursts and idioms appear organically.
4. **Readability & Flow Recheck**
   - Re-run quick readability metrics and compare to pre-edit baselines. Verify pacing is intentional.
5. **Check Against AIproofcheck**
   - Run through **AIproofcheck.md** and confirm all boxes can be checked with evidence.

## Deliverables
- Short report summarizing residual risks, mitigations applied, and remaining to-dos (if any).
- 3 strongest passages to keep unchanged (voice anchors) and 3 areas to monitor in future edits.
- Publication-readiness verdict (Ready / Ready with minor tweaks / Hold).

## Acceptance Criteria
- No open issues from prior steps remain.
- Narrative voice feels human, varied, and context-aware.
- The text can be handed off without additional metadata or clarification requests.
