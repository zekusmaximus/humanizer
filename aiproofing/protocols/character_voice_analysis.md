# Character and Narrator Voice Analysis

## Objective
Differentiate voices so readers can identify speakers without tags and so narration reflects a consistent perspective.

## Inputs
- Provisional character/narrator list with voice cues from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Dialogue-heavy and narration-heavy excerpts per major character.

## Steps
1. **Voice Profiles**
   - For each primary speaker/narrator, note diction level, pacing, idioms, sensory focus, and default emotional temperature.
2. **Contrast Audit**
   - Compare profiles to ensure no two major voices share the same rhythm + diction bundle. Introduce contrast (sentence length, imagery sources, formality).
3. **Tag Minimization Test**
   - Select 2–3 dialogue exchanges; remove tags internally and verify voices remain distinguishable. Revise lines until they do.
4. **Narration Alignment**
   - Ensure narrative summary or exposition uses the narrator’s lens (metaphors, judgments) rather than neutral reportage.

## Deliverables
- Voice profiles for top 3–5 speakers/narrators.
- Tag-minimization test results with adjusted dialogue.
- Notes on imagery/idiom domains allocated per voice.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Distinctive traits per voice are evident in multiple samples.
- Dialogue reads as identifiable without over-tagging.
- Narration reflects a consistent perspective, not a generic AI tone.
