# Readability and Flow Analysis

## Objective
Match complexity to audience and genre while maintaining clarity and momentum.

## Inputs
- Sentence length stats from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Section map and stakes per scene.
- Optional: target audience (infer if missing).

## Steps
1. **Score and Scan**
   - Compute readability metrics (FK, SMOG, or average sentence length). Flag outliers relative to desired audience.
2. **Paragraph Purpose Check**
   - Ensure each paragraph centers on one intent (action, reflection, description). Split or merge as needed.
3. **Transition Variety**
   - Vary transitions (time shifts, sensory pivots, questions, action beats). Remove repetitive hinge phrases ("as they", "after that").
4. **Density Adjustment**
   - Simplify overly abstract sentences; replace stacked clauses with sequential actions when urgency is high; allow longer periodic sentences for introspection.

## Deliverables
- Readability snapshot per section with problem areas highlighted.
- Rewritten examples showing improved flow and transitions.
- Guidance on maintaining genre-appropriate density.

## Acceptance Criteria
- No abrupt readability cliffs between adjacent sections unless intentionally contrasted.
- Paragraphs carry clear intent and transition smoothly.
- Complexity matches genre expectations without AI-like sameness.
