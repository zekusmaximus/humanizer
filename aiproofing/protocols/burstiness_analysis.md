# Burstiness Analysis

## Objective
Introduce controlled unpredictability in diction and rhythm to avoid AI-like uniformity while keeping coherence.

## Inputs
- Sentence length distribution from **manuscript_analysis.md**.
- Vocabulary swap list from **vocabulary_analysis.md**.

## Steps
1. **Flatness Detection**
   - Find paragraphs where sentence lengths sit within a narrow band (<5 word variance) or where verbs are uniformly mild.
2. **Targeted Surprises**
   - Add occasional unexpected but context-fitting verbs/nouns; insert a sharp short sentence after longer ones in reflective sections and vice versa during action lulls.
3. **Cadence Play**
   - Use fragments or rhythmic devices (anaphora, asyndeton) sparingly for emphasis, ensuring POV consistency.
4. **Safety Check**
   - Verify that burstiness does not obscure meaning or genre-appropriate clarity.

## Deliverables
- List of flat sections with proposed rhythm/diction tweaks.
- 3–5 before/after snippets showing increased variability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Variability increases without creating whiplash or confusion.
- Surprises derive from setting/character sensibilities, not random word swaps.
- Overall readability remains stable or improves.
